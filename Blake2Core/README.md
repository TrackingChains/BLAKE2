# BLAKE2
## ... for .Net Core.

This is quite literally a copy/paste from [BLAKE2](https://github.com/BLAKE2/BLAKE2) and built into a Nuget package, available [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Blake2Core/).

I needed it in my .Net Core project, and I'm sure other people as well.

Forked version of https://github.com/The1nk/BLAKE2 to support the .Net Standard 2.1
